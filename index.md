# Hello World

## Computer Science Projects

* Lab 1

    Lab 1 was one of my favorite because it was my first hands on experience on coding. Although it's simple, it's one of the most essential labs espically if you need to go back to the basics. 

* Lab 6

    Lab 6 part was very fun with especially with the game of blackjack. Who we were going to gamble in computer science. Not only that it helps us understand the random pics of cards.

* Lab 11
    Part 1 was a fun one. I love pizza to begin with so this got my intention. To add that, it uses a lot of classifications of various IDs to show and explain each pizza topping, size, and price.
